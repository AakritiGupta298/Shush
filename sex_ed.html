        Young people can also learn to appreciate and recognize their own sex: bodies just as good, beautiful and 
        special as other Godâ€™s perfect creations. Moreover, it delivers confidence to them to value themselves and 
        others. Sex education helps them understand the place of sexuality in human life and loving other people. They 
        will learn to enjoy their sexuality, behave responsibly within their sexual and personal relationships. Youngsters 
        are usually very curious to know all new things that came up to them especially abstract things such as sex. Despite 
        that, sex education plays a major role in addressing concerns and correcting the misunderstandings that the 
        youngsters may have gained from sources such as the media and their peers. In addition, they will learn to 
        make decisions that respect themselves and others by taking account the possible consequences. For instance, 
        youngsters will be more matured, responsible and social ills can also be reduced. Furthermore, research had 
        shown that children that are subjected to sex education are more apparent to practice safer sex. Some people might 
        say that sex education could influence premarital marriage, leading to the increment of unwanted pregnancies. 
        Conversely, a survey done in 1987 had shown that girls who were not educated about menstruation and sexual activity 
        were much more likely to become pregnant during their teen years. There was also a statement from the Government Review 
        of National and International Research in London that identified high school sex education as being effective in 
        reducing teenage pregnancies. Based on the facts given, it clearly proves that sex education does not lead youngsters 
        to social ills such as unwanted pregnancies. However, a slight problem might arise since sex education might be a new 
        subject or program in most high schools. Therefore, the program should be planned carefully in conjunction with those 
        who will participate and the parents. The program instructors also ought to receive adequate training and equipped 
        with the required skills and knowledge to support the personal and social development of young people through sex education.

        Sex education is never the most pleasant of the conversations for an adult and child to have. Yet, it is an essential 
        one that many feel should happen in a responsible and safe environment. Due to increasing incidences of HIV/AIDS, 
        RTIs/STIs and teenage pregnancies, there is a rising need to impart sex education. Parents and counsellors in Delhi 
        argue that banning sex education is not a solution and will prove disadvantageous instead, given the exposure kids have 
        to the internet. There is an ocean of distorted information available at the click of a button on the internet. 
        It hardly throws light on issues like gender equality, marital sexual relationships or even violence or abuse on 
        sexual grounds.That is why schools should take up these classes starting from as early as class VI, so that the 
        students are comfortable approaching their teachers before turning to unreliable sources of information online.

        The sole aim of such an education would be to teach children to establish and accept the role and responsibility of 
        their own gender by acquiring the knowledge of sex. Understanding the differences and similarities between two genders; 
        in terms of body and-mind will set up a foundation for the future development in their acquaintance with friends and 
        lovers and their interpersonal relationship. It will also help to develop emotionally stable children and adolescents 
        who feel sufficiently secure and adequate to make decisions regarding their conduct without being carried away by their 
        emotions.
